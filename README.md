Produce chartist.js charts from R.

## my thoughts

1. I am aware there are a couple chartist.js R projects out there. The projects in question do not meet certain criteria for me. 
1. This project is intended for use with [dull](https://github.com/nteetor/dull) and needs to end up on CRAN. (neither of the previous chartist R projects are on CRAN at the time I wrote this)
1. I hope to mimic much of what was built into [ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis)

## your concerns?

Right now there's a lot of room for anything, so let me know your thoughts or feelings in a [issue](https://github.com/nteetor/chartisan/issues/new).
